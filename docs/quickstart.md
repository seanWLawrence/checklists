# Quickstart (Non-Technical)

This is the shortest path to using the app well.

---

## What each module is for

- **Checklists** → repeatable task flows (packing, routines, process lists)
- **Journals** → daily reflection + habit tracking + mood/energy levels
- **Notes** → long-form markdown notes/docs

---

## 1) Checklists in 60 seconds

Go to **Checklists** and create one.

### Useful naming trick

Use `Category/Name` to auto-group lists.

Examples:

- `Travel/Weekend Trip`
- `Home/Sunday Reset`

### Checklist row syntax

You can type plain text, plus optional shortcuts:

- `--Task` → marked completed
- `Task (note here)` → adds a note
- `Task 15m` or `Task 2h` → adds time estimate

Example:

```txt
Before Leaving
Pack charger 10m
Pack passport (front pocket)
--Take out trash 5m
```

## 2) Journals in 60 seconds

Create one entry per day.

### Suggested daily flow

1. Write content first
2. Check habits you did
3. Set levels (energy, mood, health, creativity, relationships) at end of day

### Optional formatting tip

Use `##` headings in content:

```md
## Highlights
Met a friend
Finished workout

## What I learned
Keep mornings simpler
```

### AI analysis (automatic)

When content is meaningful, the app adds:

- daily summary
- sentiment label + valence

If there isn’t enough content yet, you’ll see: **No AI analysis yet.**

---

## 3) Journal search + analytics

### Semantic search

Use natural language search on Journals, e.g.:

- `stressful week at work`
- `good day with friends`

Results show confidence labels (Strong/Fair/Weak).

### Analytics page

Use it weekly/monthly to review:

- level trends
- sentiment over time
- habits and their impact
- “helpful habits” ranking (with sample-size guardrails)

---

## 4) Notes in 30 seconds

Use Notes for markdown documents.

- Supports common markdown, tasks, tables, and code blocks.
- Good for evergreen docs, plans, and reference notes.

---

## 5) Recommended habit routine

- **Daily:** 2–5 minute journal + levels
- **Weekly:** check analytics once
- **Monthly:** adjust habits based on what seems to help

---

If you’re unsure where something belongs:

- Reusable process? → **Checklist**
- Day log / feelings / habits? → **Journal**
- Durable reference doc? → **Note**
